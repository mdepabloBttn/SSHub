    // a correctly bound one both produce the legacy colour under `default`. So
    // every role this task binds gets a colour no other role uses, is driven
    // through the real production renderer (`render`, full frame), and is read
    // back positively at a named cell with `assert_eq!`. A counter-check
    // against a neighbouring family may be added, but `assert_ne!` never
    // stands in for the positive proof.
    //
    // [`OVERLAY_MARKERS`] below is the single marker theme every one of these
    // tests wears, so no two roles can share a colour by accident.

    /// The one marker theme every overlay proof below wears.
    ///
    /// One unique colour per role this task binds, so a renderer that reaches
    /// for a neighbouring role fails on an exact value instead of looking

    // time**, not the printed delta. The pass runs serially inside the frame,

    // under the spec's `2 ms` criterion, whatever share of it the gradients
