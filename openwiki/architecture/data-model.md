description: SSHub persists state in two SQLite databases (launcher.db for managed hosts/groups/identities/tunnels/audit, metadata.db for legacy ssh_config hosts), a TOML config file, and merges managed hosts with read-only ~/.ssh/config aliases through the HostResolver abstraction.

# Data Model & Storage

## Profile-owned storage

Normal installs keep `state.toml` at the data root and put each profile under
`profiles/<name>/`. A profile owns its two SQLite databases, `config.toml`,
fallback credentials, session logs, and tunnel PID state. `ProfilePaths` is
resolved once before resource construction and passed to stores, config,
resolver, credentials, logging, tunnels, watcher, and CLI context. Profiles
retain stable IDs so renaming does not change credential namespaces.

Directory overrides (`SSHUB_DATA_DIR` or `SSHUB_CONFIG_DIR`) select compatibility
mode and use the override directories verbatim without `profiles/` nesting.

## Two SQLite databases

| DB | Path | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `launcher.db` | `profiles/<name>/launcher.db` | Managed hosts, host groups, identities, tunnels, auth events (audit), UI state |
| `metadata.db` | `profiles/<name>/metadata.db` | `host_metadata` for **legacy** ssh_config-only hosts: tags, description, environment, favorite, last_connected, session_logging, transport |

The split is historical: `metadata.db` predates the launcher database and still backs per-alias metadata for hosts that exist only in `~/.ssh/config`. `LauncherStore`'s own docs admit the "MVP still uses MetadataDb" — treat the overlap (e.g. `session_logging` and `transport` exist on both `ManagedHost` and `HostMetadata`) as an acknowledged incomplete migration, not a design to copy. A best-effort one-way import from legacy `metadata.db` runs on fresh `launcher.db` creation (`src/store/migrate.rs`); a locked legacy DB must never brick launch.

## launcher.db schema (`src/store/`)

`LauncherStore` wraps a `Mutex<Connection>` (rusqlite, bundled SQLite) with `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` and `busy_timeout=5000`. Migrations use a custom `schema_version` table — base v2 schema plus stepwise `migrate_vN_to_vN+1` functions up to **SCHEMA_VERSION 13**, all in one transaction; column adds are guarded with `pragma_table_info` so re-runs are safe.

Tables:

- `hosts` — managed hosts plus imported ssh_config rows; key columns: `source` (`launcher` | `ssh_config`), `ssh_config_hash` (drift detection), `transport`, `session_logging`, `os_icon`.
- `host_groups` — nested via `parent_id`; a `reserved` flag marks the built-in **Favorites** group (found by flag, never by name — a user's own group named "Favorites" is never repurposed).
- `host_group_memberships` — M:N; a host can belong to several groups at once.
- `identities` — seeded with a "Default" identity.
- `tunnels` — tunnel definitions (see [tunnels](../workflows/tunnels.md)).
- `auth_events` — the audit log, including `log_path` for session-connect events when logging is enabled.
- `ui_state` — collapsed groups, ui_zoom.

CRUD is split across `src/store/hosts.rs`, `identities.rs`, `tunnels.rs`; DTOs (`ManagedHost`, `HostSource`, `Tunnel`, `AuthEvent`, `NewHost`, …) live in `src/store/types.rs`. Secrets are **never** in SQLite — only `has_password` flags; actual secrets are in the OS keyring (see [secrets](../security/secrets.md)).

`sshub --profile NAME db purge --yes-i-am-stupid` deletes the selected profile's
`launcher.db` and sidecars (`src/lib.rs::purge_profile_database`);
`~/.ssh/config` is untouched and imported hosts reappear on next launch. Profile
credential namespaces prevent identical host names in different profiles from
sharing keyring entries.

## Hybrid host model (`src/hosts/loader.rs`, `src/ssh/`)

`load_merged_hosts` produces the unified host list:

1. DB hosts with `source=launcher` (full CRUD).
2. DB hosts with `source=ssh_config` — rows synced from the user's ssh config by `sync_ssh_config_hosts` (`src/ssh/import.rs`), keyed by `ssh_config_hash`, refreshed on `sshub sync` / import; launcher rows are never overwritten.
3. Remaining unresolved ssh_config aliases surface as `HostEntry::Legacy { host, meta }`, with metadata from `metadata.db`.

Resolution goes through the `HostResolver` trait; `SshConfigResolver` (`src/ssh/resolver.rs`) parses `Host` aliases itself (following `Include` directives, depth-capped at 16) and shells out to `ssh -F <cfg> -G <alias>` for effective options. The user's own `~/.ssh/config` is never written — export renders to `exported.conf` with an atomic write and `.bak` (`src/ssh/export.rs`), and `conf_val` flattens CR/LF so a host field can't inject a `Host *` stanza.

Hosts, groups, favorites, and identities as user-facing concepts: [domain/hosts-identities](../domain/hosts-identities.md).

## Configuration (`src/config.rs`)

`profiles/<name>/config.toml` (created on first run) sections:

- Legacy `terminal` and `launch_command` keys may still occur in older config files, but are ignored after the external-terminal launcher was removed in 0.10.0. Sessions run on the embedded PTY (`src/session/`, tui-term + vt100); see [integrations](../integrations/external-terminals.md).
- `[clipboard]` — `relay_from_pty` (default `true`) controls whether the visible embedded session relays OSC 52 clipboard writes to the hosting terminal.
- `[appearance]` — active theme, SSHub/session transparency, OS logos, quit confirmation, startup animation. Theme definitions are separate TOML files under `~/.config/sshub/themes/`; only `active_theme` is stored here and the picker writes through the profile-aware config path.
- `[session_logging]` — `enabled`, `max_file_bytes` (default 10 MiB), `retention_files` (50)
- `[tunnel_reconnect]` — `max_attempts`, `initial_delay_ms`, `max_delay_ms`, `stable_secs`, `jitter_ratio` (consumed by `config::tunnel_backoff_delay`; see [tunnels](../workflows/tunnels.md))
- `[keybinds]` — user rebinds from the Ctrl+K editor (`src/keybinds.rs`)

`save_config` deep-merges through `toml_edit`, preserving comments and unknown keys. Env overrides: `SSHUB_CONFIG_DIR`, `SSHUB_DATA_DIR`, `SSHUB_SSH_CONFIG` (with `SSH_LAUNCHER_*` legacy fallbacks), plus `SSHUB_DRY_RUN` / `SSHUB_AUTO_QUIT` for headless runs. A staged-rename migration moves `~/.config/ssh-launcher` → `~/.config/sshub` via a `.migrating` sibling so a crash mid-copy can't freeze a partial config.

## Change guidance

- Adding a column or table: bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`, add a `migrate_vN_to_vN+1` step, and prefer `pragma_table_info` guards — tests open in-memory stores (`LauncherStore::open_in_memory`) and run all migrations from scratch.
- In-memory tests point the launcher path into a temp dir so the legacy metadata import can't pick up a stray `./metadata.db` from the CWD.

- The [file watcher](overview.md#file-watcher) only reloads hosts; config.toml changes require restart.
