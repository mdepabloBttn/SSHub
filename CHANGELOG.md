# Changelog

All notable changes to SSHub are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Esc in the SFTP browser no longer silently discards an unsaved remote
  edit** - a failed download or upload left the edit in a retry phase that
  `Esc` treated as abandonable. That dropped the working copy with only a
  "remote edit discarded" toast. In-flight transfers still block; retry
  phases now ask before discarding.

### Added

- **Local editing from the SFTP browser** - press `e` on a regular file in any
  pane (the connected server, the second server, or the local filesystem) to
  open it in `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`. Remote files use a private working copy
  that successful editor exits upload through the existing safe transfer path
  and refuse to overwrite a file whose size or modification time changed
  before the upload; local files are edited in place.

- **`sshub exec <host> -- <command>`** (issue #85) - run one command on a saved
  host from a script and get its output and exit code back, instead of
  reassembling the ssh command line by hand and losing the stored identity,
  askpass wiring and ProxyJump the launcher already knows. stdout/stderr pass
  through, stdin is inherited so pipes work, and the exit code is the remote
  command's (ssh's own failures keep ssh's 255). Nothing prompts: without a
  stored credential the run is `BatchMode`, so an unknown host key fails a
  script instead of parking it on a question no one will answer. No PTY by
  default; `--tty` forces one for commands that insist (`sudo` without
  NOPASSWD). `--timeout SECS` kills the run and exits 124 like `timeout(1)` —
  into its own process group, so a `ProxyJump` helper cannot outlive the
  deadline holding the output pipes open; `--format json` buffers the run as
  `{host, command, exit_code, stdout, stderr, duration_ms}`. A command given
  here overrides one stored on the host *or* in `~/.ssh/config`, where ssh
  would otherwise refuse the run outright. Runs are
  audited (`sshub audit list --via exec`) without recording the command itself,
  which can carry a secret in an argument. Session transcripts are skipped —
  `script(1)` wrapping fights the redirection exec exists for — and mosh hosts
  are refused, having no one-shot command mode.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **A theme picked in the picker was forgotten on the next start** - `Enter`
  wrote `appearance.active_theme` to the global `~/.config/sshub/config.toml`,
  but a profile-mode install reads its settings from
  `~/.local/share/sshub/profiles/<name>/config.toml` — the file every *other*
  setting is already written to. The theme therefore applied, looked saved, and
  the next start silently served whatever the profile file still held. The
  picker now persists through the same profile-aware writer as the rest of the
  settings, and the regression test drives the real `Enter` rather than the
  injectable writer the other picker tests use, which is why nothing caught it.

- **A stored host address starting with `-` reached ssh as an option, not a
  host** (issue #101) - `sshub connect evil` on a host whose address is
  `-oProxyCommand=id` built `ssh … -oProxyCommand=id`, and ssh dutifully ran
  `id` *locally*. Addresses are written verbatim from imported PuTTY, Termius
  and mRemoteNG files, so a crafted export was local code execution on the
  machine that imported it — no typo of the user's own required. Every target
  sshub hands to ssh or mosh (connect, tunnels, alias connects) now goes
  through one guard that rewrites a leading-dash target into the `ssh://` URI
  form, which OpenSSH refuses outright instead of parsing as a flag; ordinary
  targets are untouched. Confirmed against the real `ssh -G`, which still
  reports `proxycommand id` for the old form and refuses the new one. Such a
  value is now also refused at the write: `host add`, the TUI form and every
  importer reject a `name`, `address` or `username` starting with `-`, so the
  row never lands. An import drops only the poisoned entry — the rest of the
  file still lands, and the summary counts what was refused.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Runtime theme system** (PR #86 by @michabbb) - SSHub's colours are TOML
  files now, not constants. A theme sets any of three layers - your own
  `[palette]`, a fixed 25-slot `[semantic]` core, and per-role `[components]`
  overrides - plus named static `[gradients]`; everything left out is inherited
  from `default`, so changing a single semantic slot recolours every component
  that uses it. Every one of the 234 component roles the TUI paints is
  addressable, from the dashboard and the popups to tunnels, SFTP, the audit
  log, the identity cards and the startup animation. Colours are hex, explicit
  `rgb`, or references with `brightness` and simulated `opacity` over an
  explicit ground; `"terminal"`, `"auto"` and `"native"` are the three
  sentinels. Themes live in `~/.config/sshub/themes/*.toml` (the file name is
  the ID) and `config.toml` stores only `appearance.active_theme`. The full
  guide is [docs/theme-system.md](docs/theme-system.md), with the generated role
  catalogue and two worked example themes.
  - **Picker** (`Ctrl+H` → Theme…) - moving through the list previews each theme
    on the *whole* interface next to a two-box detail preview, `Esc` rolls back
    to what was active, `r` re-reads the directory, and only `Enter` writes.
    Invalid themes stay listed with their reason instead of vanishing, and a
    theme that mentions roles this version does not know is usable with a
    warning.
  - **Five built-in themes** - `default`, `summer`, `aqua`, `fire` and
    `high-contrast`, embedded in the binary and readable with `sshub theme show`.
    `default` reproduces the previous appearance cell for cell with three
    deliberate classes of exception: cells that carried a direct ANSI colour are
    normalised onto their semantic role; a handful that carried *no* colour at
    all now carry one - the host and identity form titles, an idle form value,
    the form key hints and the detail-panel field marker - because they were
    unthemeable and, on a themed popup ground, not guaranteed readable; and two
    places are deliberately **improved** rather than reproduced - the selected
    row of the unfocused SFTP pane, which previously had no highlight at all so
    the cursor vanished in exactly the pane you were about to Tab back into, and
    the SFTP queue warning, which used to sit inside the panel heading and is
    now drawn as its own line. Each case is recorded individually in
    `assets/themes/default.toml` and the design spec.
  - **Static gradients** - named multi-stop gradients in five directions
    (`horizontal`, `vertical`, `diagonal_down`, `diagonal_up`, `perimeter`) on
    frames, separators and backgrounds, painted by buffer post-processing with
    no per-cell allocation. App surfaces and gradients never recolour the
    embedded remote session; the measured cost is in
    [docs/theme-render-benchmark.md](docs/theme-render-benchmark.md).
  - **Themed PTY ground** (reported by @Petyok in PR #86 review) - the two
    semantic slots `pty_background` and `pty_foreground` back the embedded
    remote grid. `default` declares them as references to `background` and
    `text`, so a theme that paints its own ground paints it under the grid too;
    a theme that claims no ground of its own falls back to the `canvas`/`text`
    pair. The two are always written as a pair: filling only the background left
    the remote's default foreground to the emulator, which is what made `summer`
    near-unreadable (near-white text on cream), and it broke reverse video.
    Colours the remote chose itself are never touched.
  - **`sshub theme` CLI** - `check`, `list` and `show`, all headless (no TUI, no
    database). `theme check` validates strictly and reports `file:line:column`
    with `did you mean` suggestions; `theme show --resolved` writes a standalone
    document that re-reads to the same theme.
- **Isolated profiles** (issue #17) - each profile owns its hosts databases,
  settings, fallback credentials, session logs, and tunnel runtime state; each
  profile can select its own SSH config source while the default remains
  shared. Multiple profiles use a startup picker; `--profile NAME`
  selects one directly and `--manage-profiles` opens profile management with a
  single profile. Existing directory overrides remain compatibility mode, and
  legacy top-level data migrates safely into `profiles/default`.

### Changed

- **Transparency is a choice now, and `opaque_background` is gone** (PR #86,
  reported by @Petyok in review) - SSHub is opaque out of the box under every
  theme, and two independent `Ctrl+H` toggles hand a surface back to your
  terminal: `SSHub transparent` (`appearance.transparent_sshub_background`)
  releases SSHub's own ground, `Session transparent`
  (`appearance.transparent_session_background`) releases the remote grid. Both
  default to off. The old switch asked the opposite question and could only ever
  answer half of it: it filled what was *left over*, so under a theme that
  paints every surface it had nothing to do and was silently inert - which
  direction is open depends on the theme, and asking to *release* is the one
  every theme can answer. Both toggles release the ground, including the panel
  bodies a theme paints through `semantic.surface`, and keep the drawing on it:
  selection bars, status colours, borders and inverted chrome stay, because a
  see-through dashboard still has to show which row is selected.
  `opaque_background = true` in an existing `config.toml` is ignored; it
  described the state that is now the default. There is no transparency slider
  and there cannot be one - ANSI has no per-cell alpha, so only your emulator
  can blend, and only behind cells left at the default background.

### Fixed

- **Known hosts manager follow-ups** (issue #89) - fingerprint each
  `known_hosts` line independently so inline key comments no longer leave the
  fingerprint column blank; load/refresh errors surface in the overlay instead
  of masquerading as an empty file; refuse edits on a symlinked `known_hosts`;
  refuse deleting negated-pattern (`!host`) rows; wire delete and refresh to
  remappable `KeyAction`s (`Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+R` by default).
- **Quoted `Host` aliases in `~/.ssh/config`** were listed with their quotes
  intact (`Host "web"` became the alias `"web"`), so `ssh -G` rejected them with
  `hostname contains invalid characters` — the host showed up in the list but
  could not be connected to. Aliases are now unquoted the way OpenSSH unquotes
  them. Found by a new differential test that resolves every listed alias
  through the real `ssh` binary; see [docs/oracle-tests.md](docs/oracle-tests.md).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **Known hosts manager** (`H` on the Keys tab, issue #7) - an overlay listing
  every entry in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`: host (or `(hashed)`), `@cert-authority` /
  `@revoked` marker, key type, and `SHA256:` fingerprint (joined from
  `ssh-keygen -l`; marker rows stay blank because `ssh-keygen -l` omits them).
  Type to filter by host or fingerprint, `Ctrl+D` to delete all keys for a host
  via `ssh-keygen -R` (with confirmation; hashed / `@cert-authority` /
  `@revoked` / wildcard rows are refused, and plain deletes that would also
  remove a matching wildcard are refused), `Ctrl+R` to refresh from disk. The
  connect screen now shows the server host key fingerprint from the `-v` output
  while connecting (cached first-wins so a banner flood cannot replace it), so a
  first-connect fingerprint can be read and compared without digging through the
  scrollback.

### Changed

- Help is bound to `?` only. `H` (Shift+H) opens the known hosts manager. Existing
  configs that still have `help = ["?", "Shift+H"]` are migrated once on load so
  the new binding is reachable.

### Fixed

- **Copying inside a session reaches your clipboard again when the copy comes
  from the app running in the PTY** (PR #88 by @michabbb) - a nested multiplexer
  (herdr, tmux), or an editor set to `clipboard=osc52`, would highlight a
  selection and report a copy while the clipboard never changed. Those apps copy
  by writing
  `ESC ] 52 ; c ; <base64> BEL` to their stdout, which is our PTY; `vt100` parses
  it and hands it to `Callbacks::copy_to_clipboard`, and the default `()` impl
  that SSHub used is a no-op - so the sequence was parsed and dropped, with no
  passthrough to our own stdout. The parser now collects those writes and the
  session re-emits them toward the hosting terminal. This matters most where the
  inner app owns the selection: SSHub's own Shift+drag can't stand in for it,
  because SSHub sees one flat character grid and reads every intermediate line
  out to the full terminal width - across a split layout that drags in the
  neighbouring panes and their borders.

  Since this lets the remote side write to your clipboard, it is narrow and
  visible: only the session you are actually looking at may relay, so a
  background tab, the dashboard, SFTP or the tunnels view drop what their PTY
  asked for on the spot - and never replay it when you switch to that tab.
  Payloads are capped at 64 KiB and the queue is bounded, with both kinds of
  drop counted apart and named in the notice, so a copy that was thrown away is
  never hidden behind the success message. An empty write is ignored outright:
  a remote cannot clear your clipboard. Clipboard *reads* stay refused:
  `ESC]52;c;?BEL` is still unanswered, so no host can ask what you have copied.

  The relay is on by default and can be switched off with `relay_from_pty =
  false` under a new `[clipboard]` section in `config.toml`; configs written
  before that section existed keep the default. Note that the OSC 52 sequence
  travels in the raw PTY stream, so an enabled session log can already contain
  it - relaying does not add it to the log, but it does not remove it either.
- **The README GIFs and screenshots are recorded from the terminal stream now,
  not screenshotted** - and four of the five GIFs had no animation in them at
  all. Two separate faults: every tape except `hero` switched
  `disable_animation` on in its hidden setup (a way to skip the intro animation
  that predates the motion pass, and also the reduced-motion toggle, so it
  silenced every slide), and the recorder itself sampled the screen on a timer.
  VHS renders the session in a headless browser and screenshots it; SSHub redraws
  at ~60fps while animating, its capture rate collapsed under that, and because
  the video is written at a constant frame rate the frames it missed came out as
  a sped-up recording - measured at 0.28x real time on `navigate`, with
  transitions down to three frames. Recording the PTY byte stream with its
  timestamps (asciicast, rendered by `agg`) makes the timeline exact by
  construction: all five now play at 1.00x, animations included, and take 3.1 MB
  instead of 7.2 MB. `demo/record.py` replaces the tapes and checks each take
  against the timing its scenario asked for.
- **The SFTP browser showed your full home path**, and the recordings published
  it: the local pane now collapses `$HOME` to `~`, the way the config scope line
  already did. The remote pane is untouched, since its paths are the server's.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **Session switcher** (`Alt+S`, PR #46 by @michabbb) - a searchable
  list of the sessions that are already open, so getting back to one no longer
  means stepping through the tabs with `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]`. Rows carry the host,
  its user@address and a lifecycle dot (`up` / `new` / `dead`); Enter jumps to
  the session, and Ctrl+Shift+T still opens a local shell from inside the
  picker. The new-session, SFTP-left-pane and switch-session dropdowns are one
  widget with three purposes now, filtered by the same fuzzy matcher as the
  host list and the palette.
- **Type-to-filter in Help and the keybinding editor** (issue #48) - those two
  overlays were the only long lists you could not search. Both now take a query
  the same way the tag filter does (`› query█`): case-insensitive substring over
  the key spec / action label and the description / configured binds. Arrows and
  PageUp/PageDown move; `j`/`k` type into the query. Esc clears a non-empty query
  and closes only when it is empty (Help also still dismisses on Enter when the
  query is idle). Section headers with no surviving help rows are dropped, and
  the keybinding editor rebinds the filtered row (not `KeyAction::ALL[selected]`),
  including while a capture is in progress. Row actions there moved to Ctrl+A /
  Ctrl+R / Ctrl+X so every unmodified letter can be part of a search.
- **Stored passwords and passphrases are no longer write-only** (issue #60) - a
  saved secret showed as `(set)` and nothing else: you could not tell which one
  was stored, could not get it out, and editing meant retyping from scratch. The
  field now opens prefilled from the credential store, masked, with `Ctrl+R` to
  show and copy it and `Ctrl+Y` to copy without showing. Both say what they
  copied and never the value, the reveal drops as soon as the field is left, and
  the value stays out of every log, audit row and diagnostic. Both binds are
  rebindable in the keybinding editor, and the form's hint row names them while
  the field is focused, since a masked value gives no clue on its own.
- **Ad-hoc connect** - typing an unknown `[user@]host[:port]` into the fuzzy
  palette (`/`), IPv6 in brackets included, now offers a "connect without saving"
  row instead of reporting no matches, and Enter opens an embedded session
  straight to it. The destination is validated and passed after `--`, so a host
  that starts with a dash cannot turn into an ssh flag.
- **Local shell tab** - `Ctrl+Shift+T` opens a session tab running your login
  shell (`$SHELL`, falling back to `/bin/sh`), with the same detach and close
  behaviour as an ssh tab.
- **Push a public key to a host** (PR #16 by @vesyorsins) - `Shift+P` from the
  hosts list picks an identity, or from the Keys tab picks a host, and installs
  that identity's public key into the remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The
  remote side runs under `umask 077`, creates the file if missing, and appends
  only when an exact matching line is not already there, so repeating it is
  harmless. The public key comes from the `.pub` file when one exists, otherwise
  `ssh-keygen -y` extracts it with the passphrase staged through askpass rather
  than argv. Authentication reuses the same stored-credential path as a normal
  connect, and the result is written to the audit log. The help overlay has been
  advertising this key since the feature was ceded to this PR; now it exists.
- **Generate SSH keys from the Keys tab** (PR #15 by @vesyorsins) - `g` opens a
  form for the key type (Ed25519 or RSA-4096), passphrase, comment and target
  path. The passphrase reaches `ssh-keygen` through askpass rather than argv,
  the new key is registered as an identity immediately, and its passphrase goes
  to the credential store when one was set. Generation refuses to overwrite an
  existing key or its `.pub`.
- **Credentials survive a missing keyring** (PR #1 by @vesyorsins) - where no
  Secret Service is reachable (WSL, Docker, a headless box), passwords and
  passphrases used to have nowhere to go. They now fall back to an owner-only
  `credentials.json` in the data directory, written through a `0600` temp file
  and an atomic rename, and the status bar says so rather than letting you
  assume the keyring took it. **The fallback file is plaintext**, since there is
  no keyring to encrypt against. Once a keyring shows up again, its contents
  migrate into it on the next launch and the file is removed, but only if every
  entry made it across.
- **Install from npm** (issue #51) - `npx sshub-tui` and `npm install -g sshub-tui`
  now work, installing a command still called `sshub`. The npm package ships the
  same prebuilt binaries the GitHub release does, delivered as platform-specific
  optional dependencies, so there is no build step and nothing is fetched from
  outside the registry. Prebuilt for Linux x64, macOS arm64 and macOS x64; every
  other platform keeps using `cargo install sshub`.
- **UI motion pass** (issue #35) - the interface moves instead of cutting
  between states. Popups drop in from off the top and are thrown back up on
  close; tab bodies slide; a zoomed panel morphs out of its grid slot; the
  full-screen host view slides in on connect and off on the way out; the SFTP
  tab slides between its picker, "connecting…" and browser states, with the two
  panes meeting in the middle and parting again. The host list scrolls under
  the cursor rather than jumping half a panel, its highlight wipes in, and a
  group's rows are revealed one at a time as it folds. Status is legible in
  motion too: a host's dot flashes when its ping class changes, a reconnecting
  tunnel's dot breathes, the header tally counts to its new values, a fresh
  ping reading grows into the latency graph, and the SFTP queue has a progress
  bar that sweeps between the worker's chunked updates. Everything is gated on
  the existing `appearance.disable_animation` reduced-motion toggle, and the
  frame rate only rises while something is actually animating.
- **SFTP between two servers** - the left pane can be pointed at a second host
  with `o` (and back to local files with `O`), so two servers sit side by side
  with their own connections, listings and file operations. Transfers between
  them are relayed through a local temp file, one leg at a time, since libssh2
  has no server-to-server copy; an item only leaves the queue once it lands on
  the far end, so a failure part-way keeps it for a retry.
- **SFTP queue stays open during a transfer** - files can be staged while the
  queue runs and roll into the next pass when the current one finishes. The
  local pane stays browsable meanwhile.
- **SFTP `..` row** - both panes list their parent directory as a selectable
  row, so walking up no longer depends on knowing about `Backspace`.

### Changed

- **SFTP hides dotfiles** (issue #44), with `.` to show them - in a home
  directory they were most of the listing, pushing what you came for below the
  fold. This changes what an existing install shows on first run, so the pane
  says how many entries it is holding back, and a search beginning with a dot
  (`.ssh`) lifts the hiding rather than reporting no matches. The toggle covers
  both panes and is remembered across restarts. The `..` row is exempt from the
  hiding, being a way out rather than an entry, but steps aside while searching
  so the cursor lands on a result.
- **Smaller release binaries** (issue #42) - release builds had no profile at
  all, so they shipped with the symbol table and without cross-crate
  optimisation. Adding `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 1` and
  `strip = "symbols"` takes the Linux x86-64 binary from 14.8 MB to 11.6 MB
  (-21.8%), which every distribution channel carries: the release tarballs,
  `cargo install`, and anything that repackages them. `cargo test` and a plain
  `cargo build` are untouched, but every release build now takes noticeably
  longer -- including `just build` and `just install`, which build in release
  mode, and including every dependency, since `codegen-units = 1` applies across
  the whole graph. One trade to be aware of when reporting a crash: stripping
  the symbol table leaves `RUST_BACKTRACE` output empty in a released binary,
  so a backtrace worth sending has to come from a debug build.

### Fixed

- **Session-strip binds only worked on the hosts tab** (issue #67) - the header
  strip and footer advertised resume, tabs, new tab, detach and sftp from every
  dashboard tab, but the keys only fired on hosts. They are handled globally
  whenever sessions exist, before the per-tab dispatch. Ctrl+T still opens a new
  SSH session picker on the SFTP tab; plain `o` remains the left-pane picker.
  The dashboard footer no longer lists `detach`: you are already detached, so
  advertising it was a lie; detach stays on the in-session header.
- **Upgrading while running broke password auth until restart** (issue #63) - the
  askpass helper is this binary, found through `current_exe()`, and an upgrade
  replaces the file rather than writing into it, so the running process was left
  pointing at `<path> (deleted)`. ssh could not exec that, no stored secret was
  delivered, and the failure read as `Permission denied (publickey)`, which points
  at the server rather than at the upgrade. The path is now re-resolved when it
  disappears, so an in-place upgrade keeps working, and when the helper genuinely
  cannot be found the session log says why instead of leaving a rejected-key
  message to explain itself.
- **The agent panel printed over the identity cards** - its position was derived
  from whole card rows while the grid scrolls by lines, so mid-scroll it landed on
  a card and its own short fields left the card showing through, giving lines like
  `loaded keys 0n (no key)` and `agent socket (not set)────┘`. It is a fixed strip
  at the bottom of the tab now, with the grid sized to whole card rows, so the two
  cannot share a row whatever the scroll is doing. Sizing to whole rows also
  removes the sliver of a cut-off card that used to sit above the rule and slide
  around while everything else stayed still. The transient notice moved to the
  last row for the same reason.
- **A stored secret could not be removed** - clearing the password field meant
  "leave whatever is stored alone", because an empty field was the only signal
  the save path had. It now compares against what the store held when the form
  opened, so an emptied field deletes the entry, and the field masks while typing
  too, since it arrives carrying a real secret.
- **Cycling session tabs from the dashboard threw you into the session** (issue
  #49) - `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` there moved the selection *and* immediately opened
  the session full screen, so a key named "previous / next session tab" left the
  dashboard entirely, with no transition. It now moves the selection along the
  session strip and stays put; opening the selected session is what
  `Ctrl+Shift+S` is for, and the footer says so. The strip carries its highlight
  across instead of teleporting, reading the same travel state the full-screen
  tab bar uses. A chip collapsed into the `+N` overflow marker has nowhere to
  travel and is left alone, and reduced motion jumps straight to the target.
- **Entering a running session did not animate** - leaving one slid the session
  off to the right, but arriving cut straight to it, because the slide was armed
  on connect only. Re-entering from the dashboard now slides in the same way a
  fresh connect does; re-deriving the mode while already inside a session, when an
  overlay closes over it or a phase changes, does not replay it.
- **The session slide arrived over a black screen** - it blanked the columns it
  had not reached yet, so connecting flashed black before the host appeared. The
  dashboard is now snapshotted the way the session view already was, and the
  session slides over it.
- **Narrow footers dropped the wrong hints** - the pairs that say how to get out
  (`? help`, `q quit`) or back into a running session (`resume`) were pushed into
  the middle of the row by whatever was appended after them, panel-zoom hints,
  broadcast hints, session hints, and the middle is exactly what truncation eats.
  They are now moved to the end and pinned explicitly.
- **Arrow keys did nothing in Midnight Commander** (PR #56 by @michabbb) -
  full-screen applications ask for application cursor mode (DECCKM) and then
  expect the cursor keys as SS3 sequences, while SSHub always sent the normal
  CSI ones. The embedded terminal tracked the mode all along; only the key
  encoder ignored it. Holding Shift looked like a workaround because modified
  cursor keys take a different encoding, but Midnight Commander read those as
  "select file". Arrows, `Home` and `End` now follow whatever mode the remote
  application asked for.
- **SFTP could not leave the login directory** - `Backspace` did nothing on a
  fresh remote pane, because the parent of the server-resolved `"."` is the
  empty path, which the server rejects as a listing target.
- **SFTP staged from the wrong pane** - `←` queued whatever the *remote* cursor
  sat on whichever pane had focus, so browsing locally and reaching for `←`
  queued an entry you weren't looking at, and queued it again after every local
  `cd`. The arrows still point at the destination; the source is now the
  focused pane.
- **A failed SFTP transfer retried itself forever** - a worker follows an error
  with its usual completion event, which the queue's auto-continue read as
  "start the next pass". Failed runs now stop and wait for the user, and both
  workers are told to cancel.
- **An unreachable SFTP host opened a blank browser** - it now fails into a
  modal popup, with a connect timeout instead of an open-ended wait.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Broadcast mode** - run one command across a whole group or tag at once
  (issue #3). Pick a target from a menu, type the command, and review a dry-run
  preview (deselect hosts with `e`, edit the command with `c`) before it runs
  non-interactively over SSH on every host concurrently with a bounded worker
  pool (default 8). A live docked panel slides into the bottom-right corner and
  shows per-host status, exit code, and output with failures first; it joins the
  dashboard panel focus/zoom (`Alt`+arrows to focus, `z` to zoom for full
  per-host output), auto-dismisses on a countdown, and can be cancelled with `x`.
  Each host result is written to the audit log (with the error text on failure),
  and failed hosts pop animated error toasts. Authenticates with key/agent
  (`BatchMode`) and stored passwords (via `SSH_ASKPASS`, the same path a live
  session uses).
- **Dashboard panel focus + zoom** - focus any dashboard panel with `Alt`+arrows
  and zoom it to the full body with `z` or `Alt+Enter` (tmux-style), issue #18.
  Zoomed panels scroll, support drag-to-copy text selection (OSC52), and carry
  per-panel actions: connect to the selected host from the ping / recent panels,
  cycle the auth panel's filters, and remove the selected key from ssh-agent.
- **PuTTY and mRemoteNG import** - import saved sessions from a PuTTY registry
  export or an mRemoteNG `confCons.xml` into the host store, alongside the
  existing ssh_config and Termius import (issue #12).
- **Headless CLI** - drive the whole launcher without opening the TUI. New
  subcommands cover hosts (`list` / `show` / `connect` / `resolve` / `search` /
  `add` / `edit` / `rename` / `delete` / `duplicate`, with top-level `connect`,
  `list`, and `groups` aliases), group CRUD, identity CRUD plus `agent-remove`,
  tunnels (`list` / `show` / `create` / `delete` / `start` / `stop`, and
  `start --foreground`), one-shot SFTP (`ls` / `get` / `put` / `rm` / `mkdir` /
  `rename` / `chmod`), the audit log (`list` / `stats`), `tags`, and
  `sync` / `import` / `export`. Machine-readable output with `--format json`
  where applicable (plain text stays the default). Exit codes follow a fixed
  convention: `0` success, `1` operational failure, `2` usage or bad flags.
  Destructive commands refuse to run without `--yes` (`db purge` keeps its
  `--yes-i-am-stupid` guard). `sshub completions bash|zsh|fish` emits a shell
  completion script, optionally caching the host-name list to a file with
  `--cache PATH` so completion stays fast on large inventories.

### Removed

- **External-terminal launcher** - removed the retired `TerminalLauncher`
  subsystem (Kitty / Ghostty / custom command launchers) and the `terminal` /
  `launch_command` config keys (issue #30). Embedded PTY sessions have been the
  only transport for a while, so this was dead code. Old `config.toml` files that
  still carry those keys keep loading fine; the keys are simply ignored.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Mosh transport** — per-host `Transport` field (`ssh` or `mosh`) in the host form
  and detail panel. Embedded sessions use `mosh` when selected; tunnels and SFTP stay
  ssh-only. Graceful error when `mosh` is not installed.
  (Schema v13.)
- **Session logging** — opt-in capture of embedded SSH session PTY output to plain-text
  profile-owned files under `~/.local/share/sshub/profiles/<name>/logs/<host-dir>/`, with rotated segment files inside
  (managed hosts use `{sanitized-name}-{id}`). Toggle globally in Settings (`Ctrl+H`) or
  per host in the host form (`inherit` / `on` / `off`). Size-based rotation and per-host
  retention cap are configurable in `config.toml`. The audit tab shows the log directory
  path for each connect event. Pure `~/.ssh/config` aliases without a launcher
  row may share a log directory when sanitized host names collide. **Warning:** logs
  capture everything echoed to the terminal, including passwords if they appear on
  screen. (Schema v12.)
- **Tunnel keep alive** — per-tunnel **Keep alive** toggle in the tunnel form
  (uses existing `auto_connect` column). Enabled tunnels start on app launch and
  automatically reconnect after unexpected exit with exponential backoff, jitter,
  and a capped retry count (`[tunnel_reconnect]` in `config.toml`, editable on the
  Tunnels tab with `R`: `max_attempts`, delays in seconds, stable time, jitter).
  Manual stop or kill disables the retry loop until the tunnel is started again
  (until the next app launch for keep-alive auto-start). The Tunnels tab shows
  `starting` / `reconnecting` / `gave up` with attempt counter; audit logs
  reconnect attempts. A tunnel must stay up for `stable_secs` (default 5s) before
  it counts as reconnected. Background ssh uses `ServerAliveInterval`,
  `ServerAliveCountMax`, and `TCPKeepAlive` so dead paths (e.g. VPN dropped) tear
  down instead of leaving a stale local listener.

### Fixed

- **Session keybind hints** — the connected-session header and dashboard footer
  now show your configured keybindings (from `config.toml` / the keybind editor)
  instead of hardcoded `Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+D` defaults. Connecting-screen hints
  (`expand log`, `cancel`) follow the same config.
- **Tunnel auth on TUI** — background `ssh -N` tunnels no longer open `/dev/tty`
  for password prompts (which painted over the dashboard and stole mouse/keyboard
  input). Tunnels use `BatchMode=yes` when no stored credential is available
  (fail fast with an error in the Tunnels tab) and `SSH_ASKPASS` when a host or
  identity password is in the keyring.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **SFTP file operations** — manage files directly in the browser: delete a
  file or folder (`d`, recursive for non-empty directories), create a new folder
  (`n`), rename/move (`R`), and change permissions (`M`, octal chmod). Remote ops
  run on the background worker; local ops use the filesystem directly.
- **Recursive directory transfers** — staging a directory now uploads/downloads
  the whole tree, with a progress bar over the total bytes.
- **Cursor navigation in text fields** — `←`/`→` move the edit cursor, `Home`/`End`
  jump to the edges, and `Delete` removes the character ahead of the cursor, across
  every form and prompt (host, identity, group, tunnel, SFTP mkdir/rename, import).
  Previously the cursor was pinned to the end and only backspace worked.
- **`SSHUB_VERSION_LABEL`** — override the version shown in the tab bar: set it
  empty to hide the version, or to a custom string. (Unset keeps the build version.)

### Fixed

- **SFTP transfers follow symlinks properly** — a symlink to a file transfers
  with the target's size (progress no longer overshoots), and symlinks to
  directories or broken links are skipped instead of failing the whole queue.
- **Help overlay** — scrolling is clamped to the rendered content, so it no
  longer overshoots into blank space.
- **Settings overlay** — the footer hint no longer spills onto the popup border.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **SFTP file transfer** — a new tab with a dual-pane browser (local left / remote right): browse both sides, filter with `/`, stage uploads and downloads into a queue, and run them sequentially with a progress bar. Native libssh2 transport on a background thread, trust-on-first-use host-key verification, atomic temp-file + rename writes. Open it for the current SSH host with `Ctrl+Shift+F`; jump back to that host's session with `s`.
- **OS auto-detection** — a background probe on first connect detects the remote distro; the host card renders its logo as crisp Braille art in brand colors (font-logos + chafa), like Termius.
- **Multiple groups per host** — hosts can belong to several groups at once, picked via a multi-select checkbox in the host form. A reserved **Favorites** group with a ★ marker in the list, toggled with `f`. (Schema v11: `host_group_memberships` join table.)
- **Settings overlay** (`Ctrl+H`) — toggle an opaque background (for transparent terminals), OS logos, quit confirmation, and the startup animation.
- **Richer host card** — fact sheet with user@host:port, group, key/identity, tags, and last-connected, next to the OS logo.
- **Accept a changed host key** — when a server's fingerprint changes, a prompt offers to purge the stale `known_hosts` entry and reconnect.
- **Version shown in the tab bar.**

### Changed

- **Tab order** — SFTP is inserted as the 2nd tab: `1` hosts, `2` sftp, `3` tunnels, `4` identities, `5` audit. Existing custom tab keybinds are migrated on config load.
- **Latency panel** now reflects the selected host, not an all-hosts aggregate.
- **ssh log lines wrap** instead of truncating with an ellipsis.

### Fixed

- SFTP picker: connect to the host you filtered to (a stale index could connect to the wrong host once the search cleared); queue re-entry guard; navigation frozen during a running queue; stale remote listings dropped; search input captured before tab-switch so typed letters don't fire tab binds.
- Keybinds migration persists so it runs exactly once.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Text selection keeps its full range when an autoscrolling drag carries it off-screen

## [0.5.6] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Autoscroll while selecting** — extending a selection past the viewport edge scrolls the session

### Fixed

- Long ssh log lines are clamped with an ellipsis so they stay inside the box
- Clipboard pastes are forwarded into sessions as bracketed paste
- The connect command stays visible in the ssh log after connecting
- `j`/`k` can be typed in search and the palette; dropped bare-key type-ahead

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Mouse text selection** — select text in an embedded session with the mouse and copy on release

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **Relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later** starting this release — a strong copyleft so forks and derivatives must stay open under the same terms. Versions ≤ 0.3.1 remain available under MIT.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- README images use absolute URLs so they render on the crates.io page; added a crates.io version badge and documented `cargo install sshub` plus the prebuilt release binaries. (Docs only — no code changes.)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed

- **ratatui 0.30** — upgraded the TUI stack; dropped the vendored vt100 fork in favour of upstream vt100 0.16 (which now carries the scrollback fix)
- **Scrollable help** — the `?` overlay scrolls (↑↓/j k/PgUp/PgDn/Home/End) with a pinned footer instead of truncating
- **Visible popup frames** — modal overlays (help, keybindings, palette, tag filter, group/field pickers, import prompt) now draw a distinct border so they read as dialogs
- **ssh_config Include** — importing hosts now follows `Include` directives (with tilde/relative/glob resolution)
- **Live hot reload** — the config watcher watches the containing directory, so editor rename-saves (vim `:w`, VSCode) keep triggering reloads
- **Config saves preserve** hand-written comments and any keys SSHub doesn't model
- **Installable crate** — publishable to crates.io (`cargo install sshub`); the demo fixture seeder moved from a binary to an example so it isn't installed

### Fixed

Security:

- Custom launcher now rejects `<`/`>` redirection in host fields (shell injection)
- ssh_config export flattens newlines in fields (config-directive injection)
- Private-key passphrase is delivered to `ssh-keygen` via `SSH_ASKPASS`, not as an argv argument visible in `ps`

Stability & correctness:

- Popups no longer panic on small terminals (a `clamp(min > max)` crash)
- Dashboard, host-form, and confirm text no longer overflow their borders on narrow terminals or when zoomed
- Editing a running tunnel now stops the old `ssh -N` child (was orphaned, holding its port); tunnel stderr is drained to avoid a pipe-buffer stall
- Mouse-wheel scrolling reaches hosts past group headers
- Confirm/keybind matching: `Shift+Y`/`Shift+N` bindings work, and editor-captured single-letter bindings fire correctly
- New hosts get a distinct `sort_order`, so Manual-mode reordering works
- A corrupt or locked legacy `metadata.db` no longer bricks startup
- The Audit tab's filter/range survives the periodic 10s refresh; the ping worker is no longer orphaned when the host list reloads to empty
- Confirm-delete wraps long host names; keybind labels no longer overflow the value column

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Embedded SSH sessions** — connect runs in an in-TUI PTY; detach with Ctrl+D and return to the dashboard while SSH keeps running
- **Session tab strip** — open sessions shown in the header; Ctrl+T opens host picker, Ctrl+[/] switches tabs, Ctrl+Shift+S focuses a session from the dashboard
- **Configurable keybindings** — 61 actions in `config.toml`; command palette and keybind editor
- **Nested host groups** — groups can contain sub-groups; redesigned group management overlays
- **Connect spinner** — visual feedback while SSH connects; `ssh -v` debug routed off the PTY
- **Failure screen** — plain-language disconnect reason with dismiss
- **Multi-tag filter** — AND filter via `#` tag picker
- **Group jump** — quick navigation between groups
- **Reachable ping stats** — latency sparkline in host detail
- **Tag-filter picker** — visible UI for tag selection; empty groups hidden while filtering

### Changed

- Import/export tests use explicit export paths to avoid parallel env races
- Process cleanup on quit — detached SSH children killed via `App::shutdown_all()` and `Drop`

### Fixed

- Connect spinner stays visible for unreachable hosts
- Enter confirms multi-tag selection
- Duplicate `KeyCode::Tab` arm in key event mapping
- Group tree order in manager; edit group on `E`; themed dropdown pickers

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

Initial release — TUI launcher for SSH hosts with hybrid `~/.ssh/config` + launcher DB, tunnels, keys, audit log, fuzzy search, and file watcher hot reload.
